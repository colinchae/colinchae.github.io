i dont think theres anything im scared of saying in class honestly i think i talk a lot. actually it makes me think of something i used to do in high school with my parents where i would strategically overshare mundane stuff so they wouldn't think i had secrets and then i would be like in gay love with my best friend and tell no one i liked the same sex but meh thats like 5 years ago
