I feel like I'm not good at anything and compare myself to others too much. Since moving to montreal, I feel like I don't know how to make friends or what to talk about, while it comes so easily to others. With my creative endevours, I feel like my work is never good enough and receives too much critique and notes. I feel like I have no prospects post grad and I'll just be lonely most of my life.
